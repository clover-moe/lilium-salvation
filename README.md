## About

Dark Salvation is available at [itch.io](https://mangledeyestudios.itch.io/dark-salvation). The 1.0.7 patch for ealier version is available at [mangledeye.com/downloads](http://www.mangledeye.com/downloads/).

Lilium Salvation is based on [Lilium Arena](https://github.com/clover-moe/lilium-arena).
Lilium Salvation code commits: [compare/upstream...master](https://github.com/clover-moe/lilium-salvation/compare/upstream...master)

The engine support was reimplemented without the original source code and may not be network/demo compatible (though neither seem to work anyway). The source code for the Dark Salvation game, cgame, and ui code is not included as it has not been released; instead the QVMs in the data files are used.
